### My Work Process
---

- Create a new CSS file from scratch and resetting both margins and padding.
- Create a container and split the card to 2 sides (one side for the text and the other for the image.)

### Result
---
The goal was help me improve on my CSS skills as I continue on my journey to be an experienced Front-Web Developer.  

This project helped me alot on the following areas:
- margins
- padding
- width
- height

Flexbox is something new I learned during the process.  I look forward to using Flexbox more in future projects.
